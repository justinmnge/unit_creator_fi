                <strong>Voice and Text Chat:</strong> Communication tools are provided to enhance teamwork and coordination. Use them respectfully and professionally. Excessive toxicity, screaming, or abusive language will not be tolerated.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Language:</strong> While we understand competitive gaming can be intense, maintain a level of professionalism. Some strong language may be acceptable in context, but slurs, hate speech, and targeted harassment are never acceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Tactical Communication:</strong> Focus on providing useful tactical information to your team. Avoid excessive chatter that distracts from gameplay or clutters communication channels.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cross-Cultural Respect:</strong> Our community includes players from around the world. Be patient with language barriers and cultural differences. English is commonly used, but players should not be harassed for speaking other languages.
            </p>
            
            <h3>6. Competitive Integrity</h3>
            <p>
                For players participating in competitive modes, ranked play, or tournaments:
            </p>
            <p>
                • Play to win using legitimate tactics and strategies<br>
                • Do not manipulate matchmaking or ranking systems<br>
                • Report suspicious behavior or potential cheaters immediately<br>
                • Accept match outcomes gracefully, win or lose<br>
                • Do not intentionally disconnect or quit competitive matches<br>
                • Respect tournament rules and administrative decisions<br>
                • Maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship and fair play
